# $ A bit about me?

I am skino, a junior full-stack software developer based in North Wales, United Kingdom.

I primarily work with Laravel and all of the wonders that come with it and my stack of choice is TALL;

    - Tailwind CSS
    - AlpineJS
    - Laravel
    - Livewire

I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.

I am also an experienced musician/guitar player, I have been playing for 9 years, I share my music related stuff on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/m4tt72).
