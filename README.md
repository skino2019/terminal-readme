# A bit about me?

Hi! My name is Mike from North Wales, United Kingdom where I work as a Data & Development Analyst for the leading hearing care company in the UK. I have around 12 years of IT Experience under my belt with a focus on IT support and web technologies.

I primarily work with Laravel and all of the wonders that come with it and my stack of choice is TALL;

    - Tailwind CSS
    - AlpineJS
    - Laravel
    - Livewire

Currently I'm a third of the way through my IT degree with a focus on software development (Primarily web).

When I get spare time, I love to train Brazilian Jiujitsu at which I hold the rank of blue belt.
